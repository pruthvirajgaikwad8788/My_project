# Guess the Number Game (Java)

## Project Description  
This is a simple Guess the Number game written in Java.  
The program picks a random number between 1 and 100.  
The player tries to guess the number, and the program gives hints if the guess is too low or too high until the correct number is found.

---

## Technologies Used  
- Java  
- Scanner class (for user input)  
- Random class (to generate random numbers)  

---

## How the System Works  
1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.  
2. The user inputs a guess.  
3. The program tells if the guess is too low, too high, or correct.  
4. All guesses are saved in an array.  
5. When the user guesses correctly, the program shows:  
   - The total number of attempts  
   - All guesses made

## How to Run the Project  
1. Install Java on your computer.  
2. Save the code in a file named `GuessNumberArray.java`.  
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.  
4. Compile the program by running:  
   ```bash
   javac GuessNumberArray.java
````

5. Run the program by running:
